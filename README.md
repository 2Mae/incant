# Incant
A variety of my productivity and accessibility tools for the Unity editor, mainly trying to make it more keyboard friendly.
These are experimental and fluid, but I might migrate specific stable features to their own package.

Install in package manager from git URL:
https://github.com/Toriously/incant.git?path=/Assets/Incant

Or include in manifest.json:
```"com.toriously.incant": "https://github.com/Toriously/incant.git?path=/Assets/Incant",```
